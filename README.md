# Langs In Rust

This is a (probably incomplete) list of programming languages implemented in
Rust. It is maintained by the Ruse project as a source of inspiration and
comparison, and for others as a directory of potentially interesting projects
in this vein.

In order to be included, the language must be reasonably current and maintained.

## Languages

- [Dyon][dyon]: Implemented by the Piston team. Dyon is a dynamically-typed
  scripting language that uses Rust's lifetime system rather than garbage collection.
- [Ketos][ketos]: A Lisp-like scripting and extension language. Compiles to bytecode
  which is then interpreted.
